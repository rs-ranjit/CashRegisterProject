-This is a free code camp code.
-I am using simple html, css, js
-I learned how to use forEach method for looping through a 2D array
-- cid is the 2D array in this case which I have used to print the elements in the 2D array cid which is the drawer cash value
-The 2D array is iterate row wise in JavaScript as it is the accumulation of more 1D array.
-item[1] takes the 2nd element of each row and item[0] takes the 1st item in the array.
